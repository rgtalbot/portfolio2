              "This was one of my first projects at UCF Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to build a hangman game using javascript that allows a player to guess letters by pressing the keys on the keyboard . When I initally built the project, it was mostly Vanilla JS. The original project did have the music play when you won and the picture change."

           "Since completing it for the boot camp, I have gone back and added letter buttons so that a player can play on a mobile device. I have also reformatted the code to mostly jQuery and cleaned it up for readability."
